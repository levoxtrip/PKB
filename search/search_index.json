There are a lot of things you don't control. You don't pick your parents. You don't get to pick the country you are born in. You don\u2019t control where you start, but you can change where you go. Energy If you want to feel physically and mentally energized you have to move your body - exercise or walking. Ego Outcome over ego Expectations Our brains expectations are woven into everthing we experience. Positive expectations can trigger natural release of dopamine. Expect that what you have to do to be hard but also that you can achieve it. Many negative emotions besides anxiety can be a product of our expectations. Transactional efforts - expectations to get something back for efforts - set expectations that are increasingly diffult to meet. The more we expet from what we do, the more likely we are to be disappointed. If you try something new imagine why other would enjoy it. Gratitude Choose to be grateful.

Appreciate the small things instead just the big things in your life. The now Be grateful for the current moment. Be grateful - that you are alive - the chance that you got born - that you got born in this time You won the lottery Being alive means already you won the lottery - you are amoung the wealthiest people in the world.

Tools Emotional State of Enormous Gratitude Habits 1st law(cue): Make it obvious - Time-based or Activity-Based 2nd law(craving): make it attractive 3rd law(Response): Make it Easy 4th law(Reward): Make it satisfying Never miss two days of a habbit in a row. Focus on consistency Build Stack habits after (current habit) I will (new habit) The correct trigger is essential. Make the cue that triggers the habit as visible as possible. Mini habits If you're having trouble sticking to a new habit, try a smaller version until it becomes automatic. Do less than you're capable of but do it more consistently. Stop Increase friction for unwanted habits. Happiness True happiness comes from growth. The only way to happiness is through pain!!! What makes you happy is building and creating projects. Be fully engaged in your life. Everyday moments of tiny happiness matters more then big prices. Finding joy in life often comes fromm simple low-cost activities rather than extravagant pursuits.

This I know Narrow your life down to this moment. Do you have a problem now? Reflection Are you always focused on becoming, achieving, and attaining, or alternatively chasing some new thrill or pleasure? Patience Good things need their time. Trust the process. Have pacience. Most people need 10 years to establish their craft/mission. Two things define you. Your patience when you don't have much and the attitude when you have everything. Perspective The problems and solutions we see in front of us depend on the lenses through which we view the world. Positivity Create a mindset where you think everything is happening in your favour. If you can't do something, you can't do it YET. You are not bad at it. You just haven't done it enough times. Satisfaction Nothing out there will ever satisfy you except temporarily and superficially. Every situation you will encounter in your life will change, disappear or no longer satisfy you. Sleep Prioritize your sleep. Don't eat or drink two hours before sleep. Avoid bright blue light an hour before bed. meditate 10 min. read for 30 min. Self-Acceptance Talk to yourself positively - say thinks like I like myself. I accept who I am. I don't need to compare myself with others or judge what others do. We all have our strength and weaknesses - Neither quality defines your core worth Self Acceptance List Self-Compassion Love should come from within instead of from outside. Loving yourself starts with liking yourself, which starts with respecting yourself, which starts with thinking of yourself in positive ways. The relationship you have with yourself is the most important relationship in your life. Cherish the person you have become. We all have both good qualities and flaws and experiences both successes and failures in life. Practise acceptance . How you speak to yourself during and after stressful situations an make the difference finding calm and strength to move on or feeling overwhelmed of panic. What would you say to a good friend in the same situation? Now, tell yourself the same thing. I will follow my heart. \"I love you, you did the best you could today, and even if you didn't accomplish all you had planned, I love you anyway.\" Self-Compassion Practise Self-Expression How we express ourselves and speak to others has a profound impact on the type of world we're creating. Self-Belief Create self-belief through overcoming challenging tasks. Confidence comes from evidence of past acomplishments. Self-talk We need to learn to be better allies to ourselves many forms\u2014positive self-talk, thoughtful self-care, self-confidence, self-assertion, and the habit of making well-thought-out choices about our health, careers, and the people we spend time with Become aware of your negative self talk - distance yourself from it when it is coming up. The way we talk to ourselves in moments of doubt is crucial. Talk to your inner daemon(inner critic) like to a friend. High five your daemon. Self love/esteem Self-esteem is how we value and see ourselves Self-esteem is often a self-assessment and, therefore, a self-generated feeling. At the end of the day tell yourself - I love you, you did the best you could today and even if you didn't accomplish all you had planned, love you anyway Exercise has been shown to have a positive impact on self-esteem and life satisfaction. May you be happy May you be safe May you be healthy May you life with ease Forgiveness Forgive yourself when you don't achieve what you wanted to reach. Shadow Dance and play with your inner shadow. I love your inner shadow and tell it - I hear you Trauma The only way out is through. You can't go around your trauma. You have to go through it. Live through it. You have to tap into that memories as hard as it is. Values We value things more that are hard to get. Knowing your value hierachy allows you to make decisions that can help you reach a profound level of fulfillment. Decide what you want in your life and what you will not allow to intrude. Money Dont solve for money, dont solve for prestige. Money is nice but one can choose to see it not as the absolute measure of wealth, but as a useful tool to help achieve true inner wealth. Define your values What is important to you? What do you want in your life? What is pushing you? What is your message?","title":"Be"},{"location":"topics/be/#be","text":"Serving: Do good deeds for others. Belonging: Feel like a part of something bigger.

Responisbilty I am the cause of all my problems and therefore I alone am responsible and capable of solving them. Self We often get our sense of who we are from things that ultimately have nothing to do with who we are: your social role, possessions, successes and failures. Deep-seated sense of lack or imcompleteness, of not being whole manifests as unsettling feeling of not being worthy or good enough. The ego is a derived sense of self, it needs to identify with external things. The most common ego identifications have to do with possessions, the work you do, social status and recognition, knowledge and education, physical appearance, special abilities, relationships, personal and family history, belief systems, and often also political, nationalistic, racial, religious, and other collective identifications. None of these is you. Self-Perception We all ahve a narrative about ourselves that shapes our self-perception. If you want to change the story you have to understand where it comes from and where we received the messages that we tell ourselves. Whose voices are we internalising? Define your self perception by process and actions that you execute. Self-criticism What would you say to a good friend in the same situation? Now tell yourself the same thing. Shadow We all have a dark side, hidden agression, envy, aggressive impulses - channel these into something positive/pro social like organising something for people. Shame Don't ever be ashamed of anything you've done in your life. Face it, fix it, make it better.

The voice in your head. The voice is something we listen to and think that it is us. But that voice is not you. You are the observer of the voice. You are not the thought because you are watching it. Something that you are watching not something that you are. When something comes into you that disturbes you you need to let go and pass it through you. When a problem show up and your mind starts with chatter the first reaction is to lean away form it and relax into awareness. Every moment of life is a spiritual experience. You are causing the vast majority of you problems due to your mental reaction. Lean away from the mess that the mind is doing. Of overexagerating, overexemplifing. We have gone to the mind. and said i'm not ok. how does everything need to be to be ok. We are trying to create that sitation. It doesnt work but we dont know it jet. We try to create situations that make us think we gonna be ok. And we things are changing and they don't match that model. We get scared. Fear is a thing. It's another object in the universe that you are capable exeprencing. You either can push it away and avoid it or you can let go and let i go right through you. Life is a natural unfolding of reality. You are suppose to harmonise and work with it. And not give up. See if that voice that you are watching is actually helpful. Remove the thorn you have inside of you. Disturbance is gonna show you the thorn you are having. What is happening is irritating the thorn. Something happens outside. Deal with the disturbance this is how you remove the thorn. The fact something outside is stimulating the disturbance inside of you you uncovered somthing inside of you that needs to come out. We need to use our problems as a way through the spiritual path. You should be exicited about your problem. Because they are an opportunity to see what is going on inside of you. What do i do when i feel disturbance? I relax. Look at your disturbances and see what your disturbances try to tell us about ourselves. The disturbances are you heart that something is wrong in side of you you want to get it out. How do you get it out? You relax behind it.

The voice in your head. The voice is something we listen to and think that it is us. But that voice is not you. You are the observer of the voice. You are not the thought because you are watching it. Something that you are watching not something that you are. When something comes into you that disturbes you you need to let go and pass it through you. When a problem show up and your mind starts with chatter the first reaction is to lean away form it and relax into awareness. Every moment of life is a spiritual experience. You are causing the vast majority of you problems due to your mental reaction. Lean away from the mess that the mind is doing. Of overexagerating, overexemplifing. We have gone to the mind. and said i'm not ok. how does everything need to be to be ok. We are trying to create that sitation. It doesnt work but we dont know it jet. We try to create situations that make us think we gonna be ok. And we things are changing and they don't match that model. We get scared. Fear is a thing. It's another object in the universe that you are capable exeprencing. You either can push it away and avoid it or you can let go and let i go right through you. Life is a natural unfolding of reality. You are suppose to harmonise and work with it. And not give up. See if that voice that you are watching is actually helpful. Remove the thorn you have inside of you. Disturbance is gonna show you the thorn you are having. What is happening is irritating the thorn. Something happens outside. Deal with the disturbance this is how you remove the thorn. The fact something outside is stimulating the disturbance inside of you you uncovered somthing inside of you that needs to come out. We need to use our problems as a way through the spiritual path. You should be exicited about your problem. Because they are an opportunity to see what is going on inside of you. What do i do when i feel disturbance? I relax. Look at your disturbances and see what your disturbances try to tell us about ourselves. The disturbances are you heart that something is wrong in side of you you want to get it out. How do you get it out?

Not for others. Stop waiting for life to give you what you think you deserve and go out and make it happen. Creating as many opportunities as we could through purposefull action. Don't wait til tomorrow for what you can do today. Action creates confidence and momentum. Every step you take is a step towards your goal. Consider the future consequences of your actions. The way we act in the world affects the way we think and feel about ourselves and thoughts and feelings change our behaviour \u201eIt\u2019s all about action. Going out there, doing it and taking all your negative bullshit along for the ride. It\u2019s never going to get any better, any easier or any more understandable. This is it, life is now and you\u2019re never going to have a better moment than this.\u201c Action reflection Before Action: Will this action make the future easier or harder? What long/shortterm consequence has this action? What happens if you don't take action? What is the cost of inaction? After Action Review What did I intend to accomplish? What happened? Why did it happen that way? - root cause = the real reason something happened. What will I do next time for a better outcome (or to repeat my success)? Reflection allows you to distill experience into learning. Don't just \"do,\" think about what you're doing and what you've done. Challenging action If action seems hard, narrow the gap between where you are and what you focus on See challenges as opportunities. Focus on process Don't be overly concerned about the result of your actions - give full attention to the execution of the action itself. Inaction The cost of inaction is the status quo. If you're ok where you are, then you don't need to do anything. But if you want to get to the next level, you need to understand the cost of doing nothing. Move fast and break things The faster you execute in situations with low stakes, the more successfull you can be. Mindset There is always something you can do to improve your current situation/position. Act with positive mindset. It is never going to get any better or easier. Your actions gonna make your dreams come true. Procrastination If procrastinating, you have 2 ways to solve it: Make the pain of inaction > Pain of action Make the pleasure of action > Pleasure of inaction Reflections What can I do now to improve my situation? If not now when? What is the cost of inaction? What is the future impact of your current action? What is the most direct route to it? Would you stil do this if nobody knew? Why do you do it? What is the positive outcome? What opportunities lies in this action? Are you willing to actually do something, or are you just talk about it for the rest of your life. What can I change? What ONE thing can I do, such that by doing it, makes everything else easier or unnecessary? Am I taking action to grow? Am I taking action? Am I generating joy? Am I acting fearless and generative? Am meeting my standards? Am I committed? Resistance Nearly all of the friction in a task is at the beginning automate the early stages of your behavior. If you feel resistance before you begin, it's usually procrastination and you need to get started If you feel resistance after you begin, it's usually feedback and you need to make adjustments It's not the being creative that is hard. What's hard is sitting down to be creative. Tools Time Limited Action Pre-GameRoutine Anticipation \"Anticipate: Skate to where the puck is going to be - not where it's been\" Go where you think what you want is gonna be - go to the events where the people you want to be surrounded by are Challenge You miss 100% of the shots you don't take. You always have to do uncomfortable things in a short term to get the good in the long term Change If something doesnt't work - you need to change something Career Identify the one skill that, if you developed it, would have the biggest impact on your career Complacency The best way to avoid complacency is to challenge yourself - at work, at your hobbies, exercising. Trying to achieve something in sorter time with a deadline could be a challenge Sometimes we get complacent because we do the same things every day - get out of your rut - change your routine work at a different place \u201cThe most important lessons here \u2014 especially for young people \u2014 is that even if you\u2019re shooting for the stars, you\u2019re going to spend most of your time on a plateau. That\u2019s where the deepest, most lasting learning takes place, so you might as well enjoy it. When I was first learning\u2026I just assumed that I would steadily improve. My first plateau was something of a shock and disappointment, but I persevered and finally experienced an apparent spurt of learning. The next time my outward progress stopped, I said to myself \u2018oh damn, another plateau\u2019. After a few months, there was another spurt of progress and then, of course, the inevitable plateau. This time, something marvellous happened. I found myself thinking \u2018Oh boy, another plateau. Good, if I stay on it and keep practicing, I\u2019m absolutely assured another surge of progress. It was one of the best and warmest moments of my life.\u2019\" Consitency Consistency is key. People who do great things don't get a lot done every day. They get something done, rather than nothing. Get rather something done than nothing!!! Consitenly do the boring things when you don't feel like doing them The secret is to do few things for a long time. Stop trying to be spectacular. Start being consistent. Moments don't make legends. Consistency does. And the hardest consistency isn't in doing brilliant things but avoiding stupid ones. The difference between great success and bitter failure is often found in consistently applying the fundamentals. People continue with 10 years already still trying to achieve things Daily If you don't work hard today you won't make it next year... Wake up and think about what fun, interesting things you gonna have ahead of you today. Decisions The hard choices that we most fear doing/asking/saying are very often exaclty what we most need to do - the biggest challenges and problems will never be solved with comfortable conversations wether with your own head or with other people. Deathground You need to put yourself on deathground, have the sense or urgency - the reality is that you can die tomorrow When urgency, deadlines, death is facing you, you fight 10 times harder Deadlines Discipline The journey of self discipline for self discovery Effort Learning to access internal reward system from doing hard things and effort - you have to tell yourself this effort is great/pleasurable. Evoke dopamine from the friction and challenge. Exhaustion The 40% rule says that when you mind is saying you that you are to exhausted to do something then you reached 40% of your whole capacity. You just haven't accessed the other 60% that are inside of you. Extra It can be hard to appreciate how much a little extra makes a big difference. Making five extra calls a day may seem small, but do that for a month, and you'll have made 100 extra calls. Work an extra hour a day because you don't go out partying with your friends, and you've got 6 weeks of work in a year over your colleagues. That's six extra weeks of learning. When you consistently do more, the returns compound dramatically. Like superlinear growth curves, each extra bit of effort builds on previous overperformance. The key is that extra effort compounds - just as doing a bit less daily leads to compounding underperformance.s Failure Be wrong a lot. Exposing yourself to possible failure helps you to figure out how you can get better. You are going to fail if you want to maximize your potential! Fear of failure To reduce fear of failure focus on smallest action that moves you forward your goal/solving the problem. It is important to remember that failure is natural part of (creative) process. Failure can be an opportunity for growth and learning. Reflection Take a step back and analyse what went wrong. Every time you fail ask yourself: - What did I do wrong? - How can I improve it? - What should I do differently that would have produced a different result? - What can I learn from this failure? - What is in the failure that I can use -What can I learn from it? - What good Thing can I take out of this - Why did I miss the goal? - Why didn\u2019t I see this thing the way I could have? Goals Clear goals help to stay motivated and focused. aim high, and aim frequently. The math says so. Why argue With that? No matter how many external goals you achieve you keep setting more. It is not uncommon for people to spend their whole life waiting to start living One day I\u2019ll make it.\u201d Is your goal taking up so much of your attention that you reduce the present moment to a means to an end Timeframe 12-week time period is appropriate for most goals you must identify the actions involved in achieving each of these \u2018macro\u2019-goals Total hours per week Specific days The length of each goal-oriented work session A specific time window (e.g., from 8 a.m. to 9 a.m.) or a time constraint (e.g., before 9 a.m.) for the goal-oriented work session Quest Instead of goals set quests. Quest is an adventure and you expecct it to be one. You expect it to take you into new and unfamiliar landscape with challenges and surprises and curious encoutners. A quest is personally transformative \u2013 the endeavor itself shapes who you are, and what you\u2019re capable of. A quest has a dragon to slay (and it\u2019s inside you). From a distance, the dragon always seems unconquerable, yet the hero finds a way. Reaching goals Often when you reach you goal not much changed. Even if you reach your life goal you won't happy automatically. Setting goals Decide precisely what you want. Write this goal down. Set a deadline by which you plan to achieve it. List what you will need to do to achieve your goal. Turn the list into a plan. Organize it by priority and sequence. Take action immediately. Do anything, but don\u2019t hesitate. Promise yourself to make some small step toward your goal each and every day Create your life goals and thenn break them down to yearly goals, monthly goals, weekly goals and daily goals. Break it down in smaller parts Larger goals need breaking down into smaller milestones. \"What should i do this year/month/week/day?\" Reflection how do you want to feel while you are going after it? Growth Real growth means to expose yourself to different kind of challenges not just the same ones after each other. Do constantly what you don't like. Something what you are not comfortable with. Growth is usually painful to some degree. That\u2019s because growth requires loss\u2014a loss of your old values, your old behaviors, your old loves, your old identity. Identify Strength and Weaknesses Identify your weaknesses, find creative was to leverage your strengths. Exploid both in a wa thats beneficial for yourself and others. Love Love the process of doing what you doing! Put love at the center of your work. Mastery You become good because you are committed to get better each and every day. Diversify your skills? Mentor Pick someone you really respect, be a sponge, be obsessed and see what they do, learn everything they do - what did they do, how did they do it, why did they do it. Answer your questions in a way your mentor would answer it. Assign mentors from different places - they don't need to know about it. Exercise Ethik - Lebron James. Alter ego Create an alter ego/ a higher self that guides you through your tasks. Motivation The anticipation of a pleasure might be even more improtant for motivation than the actual pleasure. Festivals always motivated me because of the fear of missing an opportunity. Pull up the stakes of your project to get motivated Lack of mental motivation is often linked with lack of movement.

Vocalise potential losses from no deal. get the other person\u2019s point of view and see things from that person\u2019s angle as well as from your own.

If you\u2019re writing a book, focus on writing the best paragraph and not the entire book. If you\u2019re playing sports, focus on the next play and not winning the game. If you\u2019re starting a company, focus on delighting one customer. Or, if you\u2019re my kids, don\u2019t focus on the pile of T-shirts to be folded, focus on one shirt. Focus on a small but critical part of the task that moves you forward. Execute. Repeat Oportunities I'm not waiting for opportunities, I am taking action to create them. Positioning Giving yourself options for the future always appears unconfortable in the current moment. Putting yourself in a better position for tomorrow means doing something hard today. This can mean a lower return, living below your means or working hard when everyone else is having fun. \"Poor positioning kills more dreams than poor decisions.\" Master your circumstances rather than be mastered by them. the best way to put yourself in a good position is with good preparation Process Fall in love with the process of doing things - not just finishing. It's not about the goal - it's about the process of getting there. That hit song? Years of practice, countless unheard tracks. The championship athlete? Countless hours of unseen training. The successful entrepreneur? Working on a Friday night, again. Nobody knows in the moment that they are on the right path Progress We need to measure our results. Thing we measure are the thing we improve. Make your progress visible. Measure your progress - ... days in a row - 15/25 min increments Tools Win Box Prioritize which 20% of my actions bring me 80% of the results? Focus on fewer things - it\u2019s defining the few things that can really fundamentally change your business and life. Your productivity vanishes with the maount of things you focus on a day - the more projects a day the worse the productivity due to context switching. Say no to everything, that is not essential or Buffet Prio Test Projects In the beginning move fast and take high risk. Later in the project slower and take less risks - more methodicaly. Work on ambitious projects. Great work happens by focusing consistently on something you're genuinely interested in. Instead of, \u201cI have to do this project,\u201d say, \u201cI get to do this project.\u201d Debrief Debrief after every mission/projects - allows to identify what went wrong and how I can improve Define stepping stones How can I create a result every 3 days? How can I advance every 3 days? 3-day-Rule Focus Which part really moves the needle - what matters most right now? Perspective need to look at our projects from the perspective of a new potential customer and actually see what\u2019s there. Does it make sense? Can you predict what\u2019s going to happen when you click that button or open that menu? Is there sufficient feedback to know if the click or tap worked? Is it fast enough? If I read the email on my phone and click the link, is it broken? Plan You start with the end deadline and than work backwards and plan each phase of the project Revise The best work comes from having the time to make improvements after the first version is done. Use extra time to revise project. What could go wrong? Envision what could go wrong - what will go wrong - in advance, before starting. Why? Reflections What is your goal? What is the outcome you hope to achieve? What are potential obstacles that can stop us achieving the goal? For each obstacle: if ... then .. User Go out and do something that makes another person feel good. all products are asking things of their customers: to do things in a certain way, to think of themselves in a certain way \u2014 and usually that means changing what one does or how one does it; it often means changing how one thinks of oneself. To get people to say yes to a request that large, we need to (1) offer them a reward big enough to justify their effort and (2) do an exceptional, near-perfect job of execution thinking about who we want our customers to become One way to aim high is to try to make something that people will care about in a hundred years What is the user problem we try to solve? Who do you want your customers to become? Purpose Listen to your heart. Find the thing that ignites your curiosity and drive. Purpose gives power to endure the suffering. Purpose gives you filter to cutout choices: - is doing this useful for my purpose? - is drinking/eating this useful for my purpose? - is buying this useful for my purpose? Number one purpose in life is to better oneself. Why am I not doing this for myself? If you don't want to do something, you don't care enough about yourself. Find what you'd die for and then live for it. If you end up doing what you love the money will come. Realise your uniqueness: - Why are you special? - What are you uniquely here to do on this planet? What are you meant to do? - What makes you different? What is it you want to do with your life? Then every decision you make from here on out should be in service of that Reflection Why am I here? Am I to afraid to do what I really want? To whom can I be of service? What is most meaningful for you? What is your life about? What is the pain you enjoy that most people don't tolerate? What does the world need? Is there joy, ease and lightness in what I am doing? Would you keep on doing it if nobody would be watching or can see your results? What do you bring other people? Rewards Don't fall for short term rewards. You got to earn the fruits you want from your work - nothing will ever give to you. Intermittent reinforcement Delivery of a reward at irregular intervals has been determined to yield the greatest effort form the subject Reinforce behaviour at unpredictable intervals, rather then regularly Use random, intermittent rewards (like a slot machine) to maintain motivation. After your goal work, flip a coin: heads = reward vs. tails = no reward. #Toolbox On a reward day, try using positive self-talk. Do it for 30-60 seconds to reinforce the neural circuits associated with internal motivation. Treat yourself to a physical reward from time to time. For example, watch a movie or eat a food you enjoy! Rewards Enjoy a favorite snack Read a chapter of a book Spend time meditating Take a short break Have a relaxing bath Call a friend or family member Serve The point of all of this is to make the world not just yourself a better place Success You only can compete with yourself - is this the best I can/could do today? Have I gone further today than yesterday? The only competition that makes sense - challenge your self. The only focus should be on getting better at what you're doing. Focus on what you are doing. Get better at what are you doing. Everything else is a waste of time. Success happens on the long run. Set your life/environment up to your obsessions. Be true to your strength - but also work on your weaknesses. Do the work. Over and over again - just do the work. You really want to be great at something, you have to truly care about it. We think some outward success is gonna change something inside but it\u2019s not! It may make live more comfortable but it doesn\u2019t change who we are Any hole in ourself is not get filled by success key to success is not doing more it is few things really well Habits and skills to live a successful life skill and habit to manage your state and emotional actions and reactions Knowing what people need in general - and knowing and what you need in particular People skills : how to see things from other peoples point of view and how to communicate from their view Ability to focus, learn, practise, apply what you learn Do ordinary things Ordinary people can do extraordinary things by choosing to be what most people are unwilling to be: consistent, hardworking, patient, and determined. Measurement of Success It's in how you choose to measure success. I don't measure my success by displays of monetary wealth. I prefer to measure it base on social and global impact. We must take care in choosing the way in which we measure success because the metrics we choose will determine all of our actions and beliefs. You get to choose how you measure success. Take a moment and set up Happiness Hypotheticals with some of your biggest drives and desires in your life and see what answer comes up. \u201cWould you rather be rich and work a job you hate, or have an average income and work a job you love?\u201d \u201cWould I rather be read by a massive audience for something I don\u2019t care writing about, or a smaller audience for something I do care writing about?\u201d Definition of success must include how much you helped others Reflection What are your metrics of you being successful? What is working? What is not? What are other people not doing? What can I do of that? Systems Make processes/systems for things that happen regularly. Create flowcharts with steps to execute. e.g. you are tired and unmotivated - here is the flowchart what you have to execute. I'm tired -> cold shower -> NSDR -> Wim Hof breathing Create systems or routines for recurring tasks. Automate repetitive processes, delegate when possible, and establish habits that make essential actions easier Write down what you need to do on a piece of paper. Then, write down every single step you need to take to make it happen. Finally, ignore everything except the step you\u2019re working on. how can I build systems for the days where im weak and tired To-dos Attach reason to your task - why is doing this task benefit you? Why is it important? What is the task/obstacle when you take away any emotion or fear? Energy Manage your energy, not your time - What type of energy do you have in the morning? Afternoon? Evening? Determine what tasks each energy level and time of day are best suited for Work Single task focus Remember the people you doing this for / the mission. No matter what your job, find a way to remind yourself that someone needs you, and the work is making their life better Manage your energy not your time. Put your phone away. Find what is intresting about the task. Create sense of urgency about the task. Schedule dedicated blocks of time at the same time every day to work.
