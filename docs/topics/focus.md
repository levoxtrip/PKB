## Distractions
Distractions are the assassins of great work. 

Distractions are major reason why people lose motivation and focus.

90% of distractions begin within:
 - from internal triggers (emotions like boredom, anxiety, fatique, uncertainty, stress)
 - External trigger - external prompt from environment
 - Planning problems

Master the internal triggers. 


Everything you do is the desire to escape discomfort.

When things go wrong its almost because of distractions.
