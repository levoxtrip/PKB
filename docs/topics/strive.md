## Action
creating as many opportunities as we could through purposefull action

Don't wait til tomorrow for what you can do today.

Action creates [confidence](./be.md#confidence) and momentum.

### Challenging action
If action seems hard, narrow the gap between where you are and what you focus on

### Focus on process
Don't be overly concerned about the result of your actions - give full attention to the execution of the action itself.

### Move fast and break things
The faster you execute in situations with low stakes, the more successfull you can be.

### Mindset
There is always something you can do to improve your current situation/position.

Act with positive mindset.

It is never going to get any better or easier.

Your actions gonna make your dreams come true.

### Reflections
- What can I do now to improve my situation?
- If not now when?
- What is the cost of inaction?
- What is the future impact of your current action?
- What is the most direct route to it?
- Would you stil do this if nobody knew?

## Challenge
You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

You always have to do uncomfortable things in a short term to get the good in the long term

## Change
If something doesnt't work - you need to change something
## Career
Identify the one skill that, if you developed it, would have the biggest impact on your career
## Consitency
Consistency is key. People who do great things don't get a lot done every day. They get something done, rather than nothing.

Get rather something done than nothing!!!

Consitenly do the boring things when you don't feel like doing them

The secret is to do few things for a long time.

Stop trying to be spectacular. Start being consistent. Moments don't make legends. Consistency does. And the hardest consistency isn't in doing brilliant things but avoiding stupid ones.

The difference between great success and bitter failure is often found in consistently applying the fundamentals.

People continue with 10 years already still trying to achieve things

## Daily
If you don't work hard today you won't make it next year...

## Effort
Learning to access internal reward system from doing hard things and effort - you have to tell yourself this effort is great/pleasurable.
Evoke dopamine from the friction and challenge.

## Failure
Be wrong a lot.

Exposing yourself to possible failure helps you to figure out how you can get better.

You are going to fail if you want to maximize your potential!

### Fear of failure
To reduce fear of failure focus on smallest action that moves you forward your goal/solving the problem.

It is important to remember that failure is natural part of (creative) process. Failure can be an opportunity for growth and learning.

### Reflection
Take a step back and analyse what went wrong.
Every time you fail ask yourself:
- What did I do wrong?
- How can I improve it?
- What should I do differently that would have produced a different result?
- What can I learn from this failure?
- What is in the failure that I can use
-What can I learn from it?
- What good Thing can I take out of this
- Why did I miss the goal?
- Why didn’t I see this thing the way I could have?

## Growth
Real growth means to expose yourself to different kind of challenges not just the same ones after each other.

Do constantly what you don't like. Something what you are not comfortable with.

Growth is usually painful to some degree. That’s because growth requires loss—a loss of your old values, your old behaviors, your old loves, your old identity. 


## Identify Strength and Weaknesses
Identify your weaknesses, find creative was to leverage your strengths.
Exploid both in a wa thats beneficial for yourself and others.

## Love
Love the process of doing what you doing!

## Mastery
You become good because you are committed to get better each and every day.

Diversify your skills?

## Mentor
Pick someone you really respect, be a sponge, be obsessed and see what they do, learn everything they do - what did they do, how did they do it, why did they do it.

Answer your questions in a way your mentor would answer it.

Assign mentors from different places - they don't need to know about it.

## Mindset
Improvement is always possible
## Next step
Focus on the next step.

If you’re writing a book, focus on writing the best paragraph and not the entire book. If you’re playing sports, focus on the next play and not winning the game. If you’re starting a company, focus on delighting one customer. Or, if you’re my kids, don’t focus on the pile of T-shirts to be folded, focus on one shirt.
**Focus on a small but critical part of the task that moves you forward. Execute. Repeat**


## Oportunities
I'm not waiting for opportunities, I am taking action to create them.

## Positioning
Giving yourself options for the future always appears unconfortable in the current moment. Putting yourself in a better position for tomorrow means doing something hard today. This can mean a lower return, living below your means or working hard when everyone else is having fun.

"Poor positioning kills more dreams than poor decisions."

Master your circumstances rather than be mastered by them. 

the best way to put yourself in a good position is with good preparation

## Process
Fall in love with the process of doing things - not just finishing.

It's not about the goal - it's about the process of getting there.

That hit song? Years of practice, countless unheard tracks.   
The championship athlete? Countless hours of unseen training.   
The successful entrepreneur? Working on a Friday night, again.

Nobody knows in the moment that they are on the right path 

## Progress
We need to measure our results. Thing we measure are the thing we improve.

Measure your progress
- ... days in a row
- 15/25 min increments

### Tools

## Prioritize
which 20% of my actions bring me 80% of the results?

Focus on fewer things - it’s defining the few things that can really fundamentally change your business and life.

Your productivity vanishes with the maount of things you focus on a day - the more projects a day the worse the productivity due to context switching.

Say no to everything, that is not essential or

## Projects
In the beginning move fast and take high risk. 
Later in the project slower and take less risks - more methodicaly.

### Perspective
need to look at our projects from the perspective of a new potential customer and actually see what’s there.

Does it make sense? Can you predict what’s going to happen when you click that button or open that menu? Is there sufficient feedback to know if the click or tap worked? Is it fast enough? If I read the email on my phone and click the link, is it broken?

## Purpose
Listen to your heart.

Find the thing that ignites your curiosity and drive.

Purpose gives power to endure the suffering.
Purpose gives you filter to cutout choices:
- is doing this useful for my purpose?
- is drinking/eating this useful for my purpose?
- is buying this useful for my purpose?

Number one purpose in life is to better oneself. Why am I not doing this for myself?

If you don't want to do something, you don't care enough about yourself.

Find what you'd die for and then live for it.

If you end up doing what you love the money will come.

Realise your uniqueness:
- Why are you special?
- What are you uniquely here to do on this planet? What are you meant to do?
- What makes you different?

What is it you want to do with your life? Then every decision you make from here on out should be in service of that

### Reflection
- Why am I here?
- Am I to afraid to do what I really want?
- To whom can I be of service?
- What is most meaningful for you?
- What is your life about?
- What is the pain you enjoy that most people don't tolerate?
- What does the world need?
- Is there joy, ease and lightness in what I am doing?
- Would you keep on doing it if nobody would be watching or can see your results?
- What do you bring other people?

## Rewards
Don't fall for short term rewards.

You got to earn the fruits you want from your work - nothing will ever give to you.

### Intermittent reinforcement
Delivery of a reward at irregular intervals has been determined to yield the greatest effort form the subject

Reinforce behaviour at unpredictable intervals, rather then regularly

Use random, intermittent rewards (like a slot machine) to maintain motivation. After your goal work, flip a coin: heads = reward vs. tails = no reward. #Toolbox 

On a reward day, try using positive self-talk. Do it for 30-60 seconds to reinforce the neural circuits associated with internal motivation. Treat yourself to a physical reward from time to time. For example, watch a movie or eat a food you enjoy!


### Rewards
* Enjoy a favorite snack
* Read a chapter of a book
* Spend time meditating
* Take a short break
* Have a relaxing bath
* Call a friend or family member

## Serve
The point of all of this is to make the world not just yourself a better place
## Success
You only can compete with yourself - is this the best I can/could do today? Have I gone further today than yesterday? The only competition that makes sense - challenge your self.

The only focus should be on getting better at what you're doing. Focus on what you are doing. Get better at what are you doing. Everything else is a waste of time.

Success happens on the long run.

Set your life/environment up to your obsessions.

Be true to your strength - but also work on your weaknesses.

Do the work. Over and over again - just do the work.

You really want to be great at something, you have to truly care about it.

We think some outward success is gonna change something inside but it’s not! It may make live more comfortable but it doesn’t change who we are Any hole in ourself is not get filled by success

key to success is not doing more it is few things really well

### Habits and skills to live a successful life 
1. skill and habit to manage your state and emotional actions and reactions 
2. Knowing what people need in general - and knowing and what you need in particular 
3. People skills : how to see things from other peoples point of view and how to communicate from their view 
4. Ability to focus, learn, practise, apply what you learn 

### Do ordinary things
Ordinary people can do extraordinary things by choosing to be what most people are unwilling to be: consistent, hardworking, patient, and determined.

### Measurement of Success
It's in how you choose to measure success. I don't measure my success by displays of monetary wealth. I prefer to measure it base on social and global impact.

We must take care in choosing the way in which we measure success because the metrics we choose will determine all of our actions and beliefs.

You get to choose how you measure success.

Take a moment and set up Happiness Hypotheticals with some of your biggest drives and desires in your life and see what answer comes up.

“Would you rather be rich and work a job you hate, or have an average income and work a job you love?”

“Would I rather be read by a massive audience for something I don’t care writing about, or a smaller audience for something I do care writing about?”

Definition of success must include how much you helped others 

### Reflection
- What are your metrics of you being successful?
- What is working? What is not?
- What are other people not doing? What can I do of that?

## To-dos

### Energy
Manage your energy, not your time
- What type of energy do you have in the morning? Afternoon? Evening?
Determine what tasks each energy level and time of day are best suited for


## Work
Single task focus

Remember the people you doing this for / the mission. No matter what your job, find a way to remind yourself that someone needs you, and the work is making their life better

Manage your energy not your time. 

Put your phone away.

Find what is intresting about the task.
Create sense of urgency about the task.

Schedule dedicated blocks of time at the same time every day to work.


### Reflections
- What has worked really good/bad today? Why?
- Can I optimise any of the processes at work?
