- What did I do wrong?
- How can I improve it?
- What should I do differently that would have produced a different result?
- What can I learn from this failure?
- What is in the failure that I can use
-What can I learn from it?
- What good Thing can I take out of this
- Why did I miss the goal?
- Why didn’t I see this thing the way I could have?

## Growth
Real growth means to expose yourself to different kind of challenges not just the same ones after each other.

Do constantly what you don't like. Something what you are not comfortable with.

If you’re starting a company, focus on delighting one customer. Or, if you’re my kids, don’t focus on the pile of T-shirts to be folded, focus on one shirt.
**Focus on a small but critical part of the task that moves you forward. Execute. Repeat**


## Oportunities
I'm not waiting for opportunities, I am taking action to create them.

## Positioning
Giving yourself options for the future always appears unconfortable in the current moment. Putting yourself in a better position for tomorrow means doing something hard today. This can mean a lower return, living below your means or working hard when everyone else is having fun.

"Poor positioning kills more dreams than poor decisions."

Master your circumstances rather than be mastered by them. 

the best way to put yourself in a good position is with good preparation

## Process
Fall in love with the process of doing things - not just finishing.

It's not about the goal - it's about the process of getting there.

That hit song? Years of practice, countless unheard tracks.   
The championship athlete? Countless hours of unseen training.   
The successful entrepreneur? Working on a Friday night, again.
