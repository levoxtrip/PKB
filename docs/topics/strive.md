## Action
creating as many opportunities as we could through purposefull action

Action creates [confidence](./be.md#confidence) and momentum.

### Challenging action
If action seems hard, narrow the gap between where you are and what you focus on

### Focus on process
Don't be overly concerned about the result of your actions - give full attention to the execution of the action itself.

### Move fast and break things
The faster you execute in situations with low stakes, the more successfull you can be.

### Mindset
There is always something you can do to improve your current situation/position.

Act with positive mindset.

It is never going to get any better or easier.

Your actions gonna make your dreams come true.

### Reflections
- What can I do now to improve my situation?
- If not now when?
- What is the cost of inaction?
- What is the future impact of your current action?
- What is the most direct route to it?
- Would you stil do this if nobody knew?

If you’re starting a company, focus on delighting one customer. Or, if you’re my kids, don’t focus on the pile of T-shirts to be folded, focus on one shirt.
**Focus on a small but critical part of the task that moves you forward. Execute. Repeat**


## Oportunities
I'm not waiting for opportunities, I am taking action to create them.

## Positioning
Giving yourself options for the future always appears unconfortable in the current moment. Putting yourself in a better position for tomorrow means doing something hard today. This can mean a lower return, living below your means or working hard when everyone else is having fun.

"Poor positioning kills more dreams than poor decisions."

Master your circumstances rather than be mastered by them. 

the best way to put yourself in a good position is with good preparation


## Projects
In the beginning move fast and take high risk. 
Later in the project slower and take less risks - more methodicaly

## Serve
The point of all of this is to make the world not just yourself a better place
