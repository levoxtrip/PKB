creating as many opportunities as we could through purposefull action

Action creates [confidence](./be.md#confidence) and momentum.

### Challenging action
If action seems hard, narrow the gap between where you are and what you focus on

### Focus on process
Don't be overly concerned about the result of your actions - give full attention to the execution of the action itself.

### Move fast and break things
The faster you execute in situations with low stakes, the more successfull you can be.

Act with positive mindset.
