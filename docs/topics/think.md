# Think

Train yourself to think about hard problems

# First principle thinking
boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there, as opposed to reasoning by analogy.

It's about going to the end of the world chasing a chain of 'whys'

actively questioning every assumption you think you ‘know’ about a given
problem or scenario — and then creating new knowledge and solutions
from scratch.

*1.Step: Identify and define your current assumptions*
Write down you current assumptions about the challenge/problem.

*2.Step: Break down problem into it's fundamental principles*
"important to view knowledge as sort of semantic tree. Make sure
you understand the fundamental principles, ie the trunk and big
branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for
them to hang on to"

These fundamental principles are basically the most basic truths or
elements of anything.

*3.Step: Create new solutions from scratch*
Assumption: “Growing my business will cost too much money”
First principles thinking:
What do you need to grow a profitable business? I need to sell products or services to more customers. Does it have to cost a lot of money to sell to new customers? Not
necessarily, but i’ll probably need access to these new customers
inexpensively.
Who has this access and how you can create a win-win deal? I guess I
could partner with other businesses that serve the same customer and
split the profits 50:50. Interesting.

Assumption: “I have to struggle and starve to become a successful
artist”
First principles thinking:
What do you really need to create great work and make a good living as an
artist? I would need a reasonably sized audience that will appreciate and
buy my artwork.
What do you need to reach a larger audience? I probably need to do some
marketing, but I don’t like self-promoting so I’d rather not do this.
Ok, is there any way for you to promote your work without being sleazy?
Yes, if the focus of selling my artwork is meaningful with a purpose of
serving the audience — then I could make more money to make more art,
so I can serve more people. Interesting…

## Substraction
When we see a problem we tend to add things instead of substracting things.
Instead of trying to solve a problem by adding something - try to reduce something

## The opposite
What ever ideas you have or hear, the opposite may also be true.
