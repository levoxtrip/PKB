# Think

Train yourself to think about hard problems

# Problem solving process

## 1. Understand the problem

- Read the problem carefully once
- Read the problem again to look for _key words, important numbers, question the problem asks_ - highlight it
- Reread problem 3rd time

## 2. Make a plan to solve it

- Problem solving strategies:

  - Looking for clues and key words:
    _Clues to add:_ sum, more , in all ,altogether, plus, combined total more than, increased
    _Clues to subtract:_ take away, fewer than, less than, difference, less, shared, decrease, change, left, gave away
    _Clues to multiply:_ product, times, each, twice, factor, same, double
    _Clues to divide:_ share, each, quotient, every, half, dividend, same, group, equally

  - _Act it out or use tokens:_
    Use real world objects or objects that represent the problem to act out and model the problem
  - _Draw a picture/chart/table/diagram:_
    Draw symbols to represent the problem
  - _Find a pattern_
    Patterns are repeated items,shapes,numbers
  - _Guess and Check_
    Guess then check: would it make sense?
  - _Write a number sentence, number line or equation_
    What makes the equation equal?
  - _Work backwards_
    Work the problem from the backend first - then check you answer by working it from the beginning
  - _Simplify the problem_
    Break down the problem into smaller steps

- Reread problem again - Do I need to add, subtract, multiply or divide or multiple operations

## 3. Carry out the plan

- Execute your plan on paper/code

## 4. Check your answer

- Check your answer - go back to the problem and see if your answer makes sense
- Did you calculate correctly

# First principle thinking

boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there, as opposed to reasoning by analogy.

It's about going to the end of the world chasing a chain of 'whys'

actively questioning every assumption you think you ‘know’ about a given
problem or scenario — and then creating new knowledge and solutions
from scratch.

_1.Step: Identify and define your current assumptions_
Write down you current assumptions about the challenge/problem.

_2.Step: Break down problem into it's fundamental principles_
"important to view knowledge as sort of semantic tree. Make sure
you understand the fundamental principles, ie the trunk and big
branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for
them to hang on to"

These fundamental principles are basically the most basic truths or
elements of anything.

_3.Step: Create new solutions from scratch_
Assumption: “Growing my business will cost too much money”
First principles thinking:
What do you need to grow a profitable business? I need to sell products or services to more customers. Does it have to cost a lot of money to sell to new customers? Not
necessarily, but i’ll probably need access to these new customers
inexpensively.
Who has this access and how you can create a win-win deal? I guess I
could partner with other businesses that serve the same customer and
split the profits 50:50. Interesting.

Assumption: “I have to struggle and starve to become a successful
artist”
First principles thinking:
What do you really need to create great work and make a good living as an
artist? I would need a reasonably sized audience that will appreciate and
buy my artwork.
What do you need to reach a larger audience? I probably need to do some
marketing, but I don’t like self-promoting so I’d rather not do this.
Ok, is there any way for you to promote your work without being sleazy?
Yes, if the focus of selling my artwork is meaningful with a purpose of
serving the audience — then I could make more money to make more art,
so I can serve more people. Interesting…

## Tools

[Walk to think](../Tools/ThinkWalk.md)

## Substraction

When we see a problem we tend to add things instead of substracting things.
Instead of trying to solve a problem by adding something - try to reduce something

## The opposite

What ever ideas you have or hear, the opposite may also be true.

## Questions yourself

Question yourself if something might not be true.

# Scientific method

Science is the study of how the world around us works
Asking and answering questions about what you see, hear, smell and touch
Science includes:

- 5 senses
- Math
- Art
- Reading
- Writing

Investigating a mystery

What?
Where?
How?
Why?
When?

Organise your thoughts into a plan -> scientific method
a set of procedures to solve a problem

5 Steps:

1. State a question
   What do you want to investigate/know?
   _What is a bubble?_
   _Why are there many colors in a bubble?_
   _Can I change the color of bubbles?_
   _Can I make bubbles in different shapes?_
   _Can bubbles be different sizes?_
   _What supplies do I need to make my own bubbles?_
   _Why do bubble pops?_
   _Is it possible to make a bubble last forever?_
   Narrow down the question
   How are bubbles formed?
2. Gather information
   Research
   Ask experts
3. Form a hypothesis
   Make a prediction about what the answer/solution could be
   _It is not possible to blow bubbles with water, but the more soap we add to water, the easier it is to blow bubbles_
4. Test your hypothesis
   Perform experiment to decide if your guess was right

   - determine variables
     how can the variables be changed?
     decide what can be manipulated and changed
     only change one variable at the time
   - gather equipment and materials
     What do I need to perform the test?
   - test
   - record what you observe
     record what you did and your observations - only facts

5. Analyze results and draw conclusions
   What happened in the experiment?
   Did my findings agree with my guess?
   What can I conclude based on my findings?
   What did you learn?

Can my experiment be reproduced?
