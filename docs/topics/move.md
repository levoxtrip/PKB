# Move
Movement gives you energy.

The way we use our body affects our emotions and biochemistry.

## Exercise
Create joy around exercise.
Follow your joy - play basketball - go skating.

Everytime you do a workout - remind yourself I'm an athlete

The goal is not to run a marathon - it's to become a runner.

### Balancing
Put socks and shoes on the floor - blanace on the other leg and put your socks and shoes on while balancing.

## Feet
How we use our feet relates to everything else in your body.

## Movement
Movement gives you energy and hope.

Movement is how your brain knows that you are alive and engage in life.

Try to engage in multiple and diverse forms of movement.

## Pain
Pain is a request for change.

## Recovery
Think of training as a series of boxes of equal value. Each day, tick a box. The hard-workout box is as important as the recovery box. 
It is crucial not to place too much emphasis on any single box.

## Running
Focus on running just 10 min. 

For example only 10 mins a day for 2 weeks.

Have a positive internal conversation
