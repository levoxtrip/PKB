# Simplify

## Consumption
How we behave is based on how we react to internal and external triggers.

Often we end up defining ourselves by the the things we're buying and we are consuming.

Most of the time we spend our money, energy on things that benefit companies not on us. Companies try to make us buy stuff and create fake needs.

Create friction for the things that you don't want to consume.

Experiences bring happiness, not stuff.

Spend you money on experiences and education instead of things.

Often we consume as an attempt to remove an unease in ourself.

Appreciate having less than striving for more things.

Is this thing a want or a need? 
If it's a want - why do you want it? Do you just want dopamine?
Wait 25 hrs before you buy it.

### Reflection
- do you need it?
- Is this thing a want or a need?
- do you have something similar?
- Is the money spend create a lasting memory/experience?
- Will you remember this experience in a year?
- Is this object making you life better in one year?
- Will this object remind you of an experience in 5 years?
- Why is your mind so focused on consuming right now?
- Do you want to buy it to get dopamin?

## Craving
Everything you crave is because you think it will give you a better state of mind/being in life.
And maybe it will momentarily - but the trick is to focus on the now - not the the future state.

The less you crave things the easier it is to be happy.

**We need to cut out the cue for the graved or desired thing out of our environment.**

Buddha taught that the root of suffering is to be found in our constant wanting and craving.

Make your impulses consious. Bring the process to the surface and acknowledge the conflict. Accept and voice the conflict of opinions inside of you. 

### Perspective
We often just see what we don't have instead of what we have.

## Less
The life with less things is a better one - you feel more free.

Having less puts you in much more life situations.

Say no to more things.

## Reduction
Creating space is the secret step to freeing yourself from the oppression of your busy life.

Space in your life comes from hacking at choice, time and access.

Removal No.1:
How can I make every decision at twice the speed?

Fever choices mean faster decisions.

Rules. Limits. Barriers. Creating mental brick walls to stop making decisions

Removal No.2:
Work expands so as to till the time available for its completion 

you will simply never have enough time to do everything you want to do.

Removal No.3:
Block access
Protect your brain. Guard it. Remove all entry points to your brain except 

Getting rid of something is painful, but most of the time you won't miss the thing once it is gone.

Give everything away that doesn't spark joy in you or that improve your life.
When in doubt, just remove.

The things you own end up owning you.
- is this essential?
- Do I love this object?
- Do I need this object?
- Do I use this object?
- Am I sure I will use this in the future?

Give away what doesn not "spark joy" in your life.

Why do I have this?

Under what cirumstances am I using this? If no answer -> away.
