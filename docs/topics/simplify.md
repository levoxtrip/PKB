# Simplify

## Consumption
How we behave is based on how we react to internal and external triggers.

Often we end up defining ourselves by the the things we're buying and we are consuming.

Most of the time we spend our money, energy on things that benefit companies not on us. Companies try to make us buy stuff and create fake needs.

Create friction for the things that you don't want to consume.

Experiences bring happiness, not stuff.

Spend you money on experiences and education instead of things.

Often we consume as an attempt to remove an unease in ourself.

Appreciate having less than striving for more things.

### Reflection
- do you need it?
- do you have something similar?
- Is the money spend create a lasting memory/experience?
- Will you remember this experience in a year?
- Is this object making you life better in one year?
- Will this object remind you of an experience in 5 years?
- Why is your mind so focused on consuming right now?
- Do you want to buy it to get dopamin?



## Craving
Everything you crave is because you think it will give you a better state of mind/being in life.
And maybe it will momentarily - but the trick is to focus on the now - not the the future state.

The less you crave things the easier it is to be happy.

**We need to cut out the cue for the graved or desired thing out of our environment.**

Buddha taught that the root of suffering is to be found in our constant wanting and craving.

Make your impulses consious. Bring the process to the surface and acknowledge the conflict. Accept and voice the conflict of opinions inside of you. 

### Perspective
We often just see what we don't have instead of what we have.

## Less
The life with less things is a better one - you feel more free.

## Reduction
Getting red of something is painful, but most of the time you won't miss the thing once it is gone.

Give everything away that doesn't spark joy in you or that improve your life.
When in doubt, just remove.

The things you own end up owning you.

- Do I love this object?
- Do I need this object?
- Do I use this object?
- Am I sure I will use this in the future?

### Extremes
- If a fire would burn down your house would you rescure this or something else?
