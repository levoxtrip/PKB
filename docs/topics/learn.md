# Learn

Goal is to understand how system/topic works and the various ways you can use them to your advantage.

# Questions

## While learning

What are the fundamental principle/rule that this topic build opon - why do they work this way/why do they get used here?

## developing process understanding

If I break down how this works into its most essential steps/components - what would they be - how do they interact to create the whole

## Application

Where else could these core principles apply - in unexpected ways
How might i use them to solve different problems

## Basic concepts

When you start to study a field you need to identify the core principles than govern the field.

When you're starting something new, the most important thing is knowing what to learn.

Build the fundamentals and practise them over and over.

What are the patterns that get used in this framework.

## Projects
Expand your knowledge by working on projects! Go from projects to projects learning new things that you think are cool and interesting.

Experimentation and exploration. Fun hobby projects.

Look between connections between these fields and look for there applications.

Write a lot of code and continously try to improve.

Constantly push yourself to learn more and more

## Curiosity

When we are emotionally engaged our brain learns 3-4 times faster.
Create curiosity and aw around the topic.

Ask "Why, Why, Why, Why"

## Deliberate practise

Train at the edge of your ability.
Test your knowledge

If something is diffucult to execute or hard to comprehend its a sign of learning and making lasting improvements

How can I challenge myself by using another tool/less code/more code/a diffrent object to achieve what I want

## Draw

Draw charts/diagrams to enhance learning and improve understanding.

"Wayne Gretzki used a pen to follow the puck's movement during a game without looking down."

## Learning Flow

0. Testing part from last time
1. Curiosity
   "Understanding this topic will help you a l ot in the future"
   "ask why why why why
2. Learning Session
   3\*20 Min

- Watch/read the information
- Explain concept to yourself
- Try to execute the information by yourself - active recall to improve the learning
- Reread
- Retry

3. Reflection

- What is the first principle of this topic/ knowledge

4. NSDR

## Mistakes

Every error is a system error.

When you make a mistake - log that mistake so you can learn from it!

Adjust environment or leverage technology

### Mistake reframes

"What part of my system needs improvement?"

- Mistakes are system flaws - nothing personal about them
- Mistake is signal/opportunity to upgrade and redesign your daily system of living.

- establish rituals at beginning and eng of the day to rehearse daily rules
- Daily rules note on phone
  "no social media before noon"
- End of day rehearse:
  "Did I do my best to ... ?"

When something goes wrong - assume it will show again unless you systematically resolve it.

Mistakes inform success

Everything is a result of thousands of little mistakes that got fixed.

Analyse your mistakes and poor performances

Mistakes are confident builders.

Fail, fail fail, succeed.

## NSDR

After 90 min of learning session do a 20 min NSDR.

## Project based learning

Work on a specific project. Pick a project that you are interested in and build it.

Assign to hackathons

## Play

Inject something playful to make the learning more fun.

## Reflection

We learn from the reflection/ active recall of the learned information.

- What principles did I learn today?

## Write

Write your learnings on paper
