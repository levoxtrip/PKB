See other peoples works in forums, reddit, instagram and try to create it yourself

Study other poples work curiously to learn instead of beeing ashamed or jelous.


## Ideas
Realise the ideas you have.

Go where the ideas tell you where to go. That leads you to the places.

Properly write down the ideas so when you read it again the ideas come back in full.

Save the writings.

Have patience to get the ideas. 

Calm down and leasurly examine it. First it is flash and then pops in an image/sound/feeling. Then continuing focusing on that.

A lot of ideas come from our world.
