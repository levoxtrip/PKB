There is only one success—to be able to spend your life in your own way.

The struggle is the one constant in all of our lives.
Many people never realize that there can be no “salvation” in anything they do, possess, or attain.

Everything in your life can change really fast. In a second, it can all change. An accident. A diagnosis. A news alert. You could lose everything you have. If that happens are you prepared for mean fate, misfortune, unpredictable and unpleasant cirumstances?

Life is 10% what happens and 90% how we react to it.
Are you mentally prepared for a world you cannot control?

Always remember there are only three goals.

To want nothing. That’s contentment.

To do anything. That’s freedom.

To have everything. That’s happiness.

## Challenges
Whenever anything negative happens to you, there is a deep lesson concealed within it, although you may not see it at the time

## Choice
Integrity is a choice.

Kindness is a choice.

Hard work is a choice.

Preparation is a choice.

Consistency is a choice.

Your attitude is a choice.

Your response is a choice.

Marriage is hard - Divorce is hard
Obesity is hard - getting fit is hard
Being in debt is hard - being financially disciplined is hard Communication is hard - not communicating is hard
Parenting is hard - growing old alone is hard
Working for someone is hard - running a business is hard
Caring for your employees is hard - Doing everything by yourself is hard
Trusting someone is hard - being cynical is hard
Loving someone is hard - being lonely is hard

Life will never be easy. It will always be hard But we can choose our hard


## Entropy
Entropy, as a measure of disorder, explains why life always seems to get more, not less, complicated as time goes on.

Disorder is not a mistake; it is the default. Order is always artificial and temporary.

## Flow
you have to allow to get carried away by the waves ts to hard to super intentionally plan your life allow what ever happens you should stay open to where ever your life brings you
## Life situation
If you find your here and now intolerable and it makes you unhappy, you have three options: remove yourself from the situation, change it, or accept it totally Then accept the consequences
## Pushing limits
Life is too short to do mediocre work and it is definitely too short to build shitty things life is too short to be scared of problems

* Great work gets ignored
* Stop asking for permission
* You don't need gatekeepers to be

## Reflections
- Have you done everything you wanted to do in your life?
- If you had the ability to wave a magic wand and utterly change your life, how differently would it look?
