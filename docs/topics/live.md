There is only one success—to be able to spend your life in your own way.

The struggle is the one constant in all of our lives.
Many people never realize that there can be no “salvation” in anything they do, possess, or attain.

Everything in your life can change really fast. In a second, it can all change. An accident. A diagnosis. A news alert. You could lose everything you have. If that happens are you prepared for mean fate, misfortune, unpredictable and unpleasant cirumstances?

Life is 10% what happens and 90% how we react to it.
Are you mentally prepared for a world you cannot control?

Always remember there are only three goals.

To want nothing. That’s contentment.

To do anything. That’s freedom.

To have everything. That’s happiness.

Trust the messages of life instead of understanding them intellectually

## Challenges
Whenever anything negative happens to you, there is a deep lesson concealed within it, although you may not see it at the time

## Choice
Integrity is a choice.

Kindness is a choice.

Hard work is a choice.

Preparation is a choice.

Consistency is a choice.

Your attitude is a choice.

Your response is a choice.

## Entropy
Entropy, as a measure of disorder, explains why life always seems to get more, not less, complicated as time goes on.

Disorder is not a mistake; it is the default. Order is always artificial and temporary.

## Flow
you have to allow to get carried away by the waves ts to hard to super intentionally plan your life allow what ever happens you should stay open to where ever your life brings you
## Life situation
If you find your here and now intolerable and it makes you unhappy, you have three options: remove yourself from the situation, change it, or accept it totally Then accept the consequences
## Pushing limits
Life is too short to do mediocre work and it is definitely too short to build shitty things life is too short to be scared of problems

* Great work gets ignored
* Stop asking for permission
* You don't need gatekeepers to be

## Reflections
- Have you done everything you wanted to do in your life?
- If you had the ability to wave a magic wand and utterly change your life, how differently would it look?

## Luxury
The real luxuries in life are time and health.
time health
a quiet mind
slow mornings
ability to travel
rest without guilt
a good night's sleep
calm and "boring" days
meaningful conversations
home-cooked meals
people you love
people who love you back
