# Operating Manual

## Rule 1 - Make decisions
We are often scared of the changes from the decisions we make.

Do you want to stay who and where you are or do you want to grow and move forward?

The step into uncertain terretory creates opportunities for new experiences and growth.

Do you want to hold on to things from the past or do you want to let go of it and open up for new things and a richer future?

Do you hold on to the things of your past and the things that you have?
Do you want to live in the grey zone or in the bright and dark extremes?

Don't hold on to a situation that doesn't make you happy.

You can take the risk because everything is better than an unsatisfying mininmal existence in the grey zone.

*What can you gain doing this?*

Not deciding is also a decision. You decide that everything should stay how it is.

Ask yourself do you love what you do? And how can I make it lovable/fun?

There are no false decisions - you will never know how you life would have turned out if you have decided for the other thing - what would have happened to you there.
We will never know if the other choice really would have been a better decision. 
Every decision is better than no decision.

Decide fast and then stay with the decision.

Your decisions shape who you are. You are what you decide to do and not do!

The biggest risk is to live a life that you don't like to live.

Every decision - Is this something that I really want to do and that brings me to where I want to be?
What are your values?
### Tool
Today I make every decision in 30 seconds.

I ask before every decision: What are the consequences, if I decide a certain way?  Will this decision bring me luck or happiness?

I do I want to be in 5 years? What do I want to do in 5 years? Every decisions get lead by that goals. I'm ready to get rid of things that I don't like or that doesn't lead me that way.

What is a decision that I keep pushing in front of me put am not taking? What are the options i have. Can I talk to somebody to help me with that. Set a written deadline till when I do the decision.

## Rule 2 - Allways learn
Everything in live takes time to develop.

Our small everyday decisions and the big decisions add up to how your future is turning out to be.
