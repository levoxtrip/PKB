Constantly conduct experiments - in big and small ways. New industries. New Hobbies. New technologies. New roles. New People. new side hustles

## Ideas
Reading artbooks relaxed on saturday morning gives me great new ideas

No input -> no output. If you don’t take things in you can’t put something Out

Make time for play, relaxation and exploration

## Writing
Curiosity is the crack cocaine of the writing world. Hook your readers, and they'll follow you. 

Keep it simple: Just one thought per sentence. Bite-sized and easily digestible
