# Die

Youâ€™re going to die one day, and none of this is going to matter. So enjoy yourself. Do something positive. Project some love. Make someone happy. Laugh a little bit. Appreciate the moment. And do your work

To remind yourself that you gonna die, is a good way to avoid the thought, that you have something to loose in your life.There is no reason not to follow your heart

Death is a stripping away of all that is not you.

## Regrets

Five greatest regrets of people dying:

- I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life of others.

- I wish I hadn't worked so hard.

- I wish I had the courage to express my feelings.

- I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.

- I wish that I had let myself be happier.
