## Behaviour

### Awareness
Stop giving your attention to anything that isn't contributing to your happiness or goal.

Single Focus on the moment/ the thing right in front of you

#### Tools
10 to 25 minutes

Tune Into Yourself: Lie down comfortably and close your eyes. Focus your attention like a flashlight, scanning your body from head to toe.

Breathe Mindfully: Breathe in your own rhythm. Let your thoughts wander as you inhale, but try to focus on the sensation of air leaving your lungs as you exhale.

Three, Two, One: Notice three things: a chair, wall, plant. Then, focus on three sounds. Feel three objects. Repeat the exercise with two things, then one. It helps break repetitive thought loops.

Sit Still: Sit and fix your gaze about 1.5 meters away on a spot on the wall or floor. Keep your eyes half-closed and tune into yourself. Move as little as possible.

Notice the Gaps: Find a quiet spot and focus on the spaces between things: the pauses between breaths, swallows, and blinks. Pay attention to how your fingers or lips are positioned.

Feel the Progress: Walk slowly, noticing every movement with each step: the weight shift, foot placement, rolling motion, and muscle work in your calves, thighs, and glutes.
