# Prioritize
Do less but do better.

Most people attempt to do too many things. The problem
is that too many priorities divide your attention, reduce the
quality of your work, and stress you out. On top of that, none
of them seem to get done.

Write down your top ten objectives for 2024. Now circle the
three to four that matter most to you.

Everything not circled should now be considered your ‘avoid
at all costs’ list. That doesn’t mean you don’t care about them
- you do. But all of these things distract you from what really
matters. All the energy that goes into your 9th-objective
comes at the expense of your top one.
