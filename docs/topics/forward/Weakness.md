# Weakness
We all have strengths and weaknesses. By identifying and
minimizing our weaker areas, we demonstrate self-acceptance
and resilience.

Consider areas like investing (where index funds might be more
effective), managing people, cooking, or hiring practices, and
think about strategies to address these challenges.
