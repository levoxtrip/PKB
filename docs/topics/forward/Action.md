# Action

## Mindset
There is always something you can do to improve your current situation/postion.

Act with a positive mindset.

It is never going to get any better or any easier

Your work, your projects, your business, your actions gonna make your dreams come true

### You take the action
we often respond to actions with similar reactions. If someone doesn’t help us, we don’t go out of our way to help them in return;

To get this powerful force working for you, identify the areas
in your life where you are passively waiting for someone to
make the first move.

It could be an apology, asking someone on a date, or waiting for someone to see your potential.

Stop waiting for life to give you what you think you deserve and go out and make it happen.

Reflect on where you might be passively waiting for others to act. What proactive steps can you take to initiate positive
outcomes?

## Start action
