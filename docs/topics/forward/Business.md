Reach out cold to people

you gotta have a little fuck it in your system

Proximity is power - if you know nothing get close to the people that do what you want to do

In life it is a lot more about motion than it is about direction

Be frugal

be the curious novice

Dont overthink stuff - make it easy 

Don't get to dependend on another service like insta, youtube, facebook
If they change something you get to dependend


## Business Ideas
Understand how other people think and feel
Understanding other peoples perspektive - figuering out if you can solve that for them

Straightforward fundamental thinking - I have this much money, I want to get more money back - what do people want/ what do people need.

Follower for 5000 people and create a course to sell it to them
look for the keywords - answer what the others


Start blogging - learn one new intresting a week and blog about what you learned - every day every week for a year 

ahrefs search for the key words


be one step in front of your audience

go on yelp - find a niche
