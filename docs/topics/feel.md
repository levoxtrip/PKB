# Feel
Feelings are signals/messages.

If you have difficulty feeling your emotions start focusing your attention on the inner energy field in your body.

Not expressing your emotions can ahve severe physiological problems.


## Acceptance
Accept the present moment like you have chosen it to be like it is - unconditionally and without reservation

Anything you accept fully will get you there, will take you into peace.

Instead of surpressing unpleasant feelings, accept the feelings.

Accept what you have and how your life is.


## Approval
Low [self-esteem](be.md#self-loveesteem) and neglectful experiences with your first caregivers may make you constanty need and seek approval as an adult.

### Reflection
- When is it that you crave others approval most? At work?

### Tools

## Completeness
To fill the hole of feeling uncomplete we enter the pursuit of ego gratification and strive after possesions, money, success or recognition - so we can feel better about ourselves. But even with these things the hole is still there. 


## Dreams
In our dreams we process what we have experienced.

## Ego
Ego is always seeking for something to attach itself to in order to uphold and strengthen it's illusory sense of self. It will attach itself to your problems.

The ego's needs are endless.

## Emotions
Stop let your emotions drive our behaviour.

Emotions are your bodys reaction to your mind

### Feeling attacked
That what other people say to you has nothing to do with you.

## Forgive
Forgive other people, not necessarily because they deserve it but because you deserve it.

I decide to leave all the old relationships behind me. I decide to forgive.

## Intrusive Thoughts
Intrusive thoughts are simulations of the brain of a worst case scenarios to prepare us for them. Accessing risk and consequences.

Accept that this is how you brain works to adapt to uncertain circumstances.

## Light
Be outside 45 min a day.
Most light you get in the morning.## Intrusive Thoughts
Intrusive thoughts are simulations of the brain of a worst case scenarios to prepare us for them. Accessing risk and consequences.

Accept that this is how you brain works to adapt to uncertain circumstances.
## Mind
What we feel and think will determine what we experience - what we experience determines how we feel and think - never-ending-cycle

Our brains expectations are woven into everything we experience

## Pain
To disidentify from the pain bring precence into the pain and transmute it.

## Responisbilty
I am the cause of all my problems and therefore I alone am responsible and capable of solving them.

## Self
We often get our sense of who we are from things that ultimately have nothing to do with who we are: your social role, possessions, successes and failures.

Deep-seated sense of lack or imcompleteness, of not being whole manifests as unsettling feeling of not being worthy or good enough.

The ego is a derived sense of self, it needs to identify with external things. The most common ego identifications have to do with possessions, the work you do, social status and recognition, knowledge and education, physical appearance, special abilities, relationships, personal and family history, belief systems, and often also political, nationalistic, racial, religious, and other collective identifications. None of these is you.



## Self-Perception
We all ahve a narrative about ourselves that shapes our self-perception.

If you want to change the story you have to understand where it comes from and where we received the messages that we tell ourselves.
Whose voices are we internalising?

Define your self perception by process and actions that you execute.

### Self-criticism
- What would you say to a good friend in the same situation?
Now tell yourself the same thing.

## Shadow
We all have a dark side, hidden agression, envy, aggressive impulses - channel these into something positive/pro social like organising something for people.


## Shame
Don't ever be ashamed of anything you've done in your life. Face it, fix it, make it better.

## Stress
Stress relief strategies are:
- exercising
- yoga, meditation, breathing
- reading
- listening to music
- going for walk outside + go into nature
- PMR
- paint
- video games
- MBSR 

### Eating
When I don't eat enough my body gets stressed
## Surrender
What is not servicing you let it go

you are on a path of experience for the purpose of your own growth and evolution and healing.


## Struggles

The most situations that seem negative in the beginning actually bring something positive within - something to learn.


## Thoughts
Our thoughts shape our world.
Disidentify with your thoughts - your are not your thoughts. You are the observer.

Pay attention to any repetitive thought patterns.
