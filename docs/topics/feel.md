## Acceptance
Accept the present moment like you have chosen it to be like it is - unconditionally and without reservation

Anything you accept fully will get you there, will take you into peace.

Instead of surpressing unpleasant feelings, accept the feelings.

Accept what you have and how your life is.


## Completeness
To fill the hole of feeling uncomplete we enter the pursuit of ego gratification and strive after possesions, money, success or recognition - so we can feel better about ourselves. But even with these things the hole is still there. 

## Emotions
Stop let your emotions drive our behaviour.

Emotions are your bodys reaction to your mind

## Forgive
Forgive other people, not necessarily because they deserve it but because you deserve it.

I decide to leave all the old relationships behind me. I decide to forgive.

## Mind
What we feel and think will determine what we experience - what we experience determines how we feel and think - never-ending-cycle

Our brains expectations are woven into everything we experience

## Pain
To disidentify from the pain bring precence into the pain and transmute it.

## Responisbilty
I am the cause of all my problems and therefore I alone am responsible and capable of solving them.

## Shame
Don't ever be ashamed of anything you've done in your life. Face it, fix it, make it better.

## Stress


## Struggles
The most situations that seem negative in the beginning actually bring something positive within - something to learn.
