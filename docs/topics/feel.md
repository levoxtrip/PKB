## Acceptance
Accept the present moment like you have chosen it to be like it is - unconditionally and without reservation

Anything you accept fully will get you there, will take you into peace.

Instead of surpressing unpleasant feelings, accept the feelings.

Accept what you have and how your life is.

## Emotions
Stop let your emotions drive our behaviour

## Responisbilty
I am the cause of all my problems and therefore I alone am responsible and capable of solving them.

## Shame
Don't ever be ashamed of anything you've done in your life. Face it, fix it, make it better.

## Struggles
The most situations that seem negative in the beginning actually bring something positive within - something to learn.
