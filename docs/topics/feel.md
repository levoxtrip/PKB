# Feel

Feelings are signals/messages.

If you have difficulty feeling your emotions start focusing your attention on the inner energy field in your body.

Not expressing your emotions can have severe physiological problems.

## Acceptance

I am enough!
Accept the present moment like you have chosen it to be like it is - unconditionally and without reservation

Anything you accept fully will get you there, will take you into peace.

Instead of suppressing unpleasant feelings, accept the feelings.

Accept what you have and how your life is.

## Approval

Low [self-esteem](be.md#self-loveesteem) and neglectful experiences with your first caregivers may make you constanty need and seek approval as an adult.

### Reflection

- When is it that you crave others approval most? At work?

## Anxiety

How you handle anxiety is one of the most important qualities in your life.

Often anxiety is a signal that there is a problem that you don't understand / can't resolve.

You don't want to act when you are anxious.

### Exposure

Anxiety can also be a compass for where your biggest growth lies.

Expose yourself to small anxiety educing situations and learn to manage the difficult feelings.

In exposure therapy people are encouraged to directly confront their fears to recalibrating the perceptions

### Reflection

- What triggers anxiety in you? What caused your anxiety in the past?

### Tools

- Write down anxious thoughts on paper.
- What is the smallest step/action I can take right now?
- Reduce you media intake, no news, no social media for most of the week

## Completeness

To fill the hole of feeling uncomplete we enter the pursuit of ego gratification and strive after possesions, money, success or recognition - so we can feel better about ourselves. But even with these things the hole is still there.

## Dreams

In our dreams we process what we have experienced.

## Ego

Ego is always seeking for something to attach itself to in order to uphold and strengthen it's illusory sense of self. It will attach itself to your problems.

The ego's needs are endless.

## Emotions

Stop let your emotions drive our behaviour.

Emotions are your bodys reaction to your mind

### Feeling attacked

That what other people say to you has nothing to do with you.

## Forgive

Forgive other people, not necessarily because they deserve it but because you deserve it.

I decide to leave all the old relationships behind me. I decide to forgive.

## Intrusive Thoughts

Intrusive thoughts are simulations of the brain of a worst case scenarios to prepare us for them. Accessing risk and consequences.

Accept that this is how you brain works to adapt to uncertain circumstances.

## Light

Be outside 45 min a day.
Most light you get in the morning.## Intrusive Thoughts
Intrusive thoughts are simulations of the brain of a worst case scenarios to prepare us for them. Accessing risk and consequences.

Accept that this is how you brain works to adapt to uncertain circumstances.

## Mind

What we feel and think will determine what we experience - what we experience determines how we feel and think - never-ending-cycle

Our brains expectations are woven into everything we experience

## Pain

To disidentify from the pain bring precence into the pain and transmute it.

Engage with the pain by looking it in the eye.
Observing it.
## Responsibility

I am the cause of all my problems and therefore I alone am responsible and capable of solving them.

## Self

We often get our sense of who we are from things that ultimately have nothing to do with who we are: your social role, possessions, successes and failures.

Deep-seated sense of lack or imcompleteness, of not being whole manifests as unsettling feeling of not being worthy or good enough.

The ego is a derived sense of self, it needs to identify with external things. The most common ego identifications have to do with possessions, the work you do, social status and recognition, knowledge and education, physical appearance, special abilities, relationships, personal and family history, belief systems, and often also political, nationalistic, racial, religious, and other collective identifications. None of these is you.

## Self-Perception

We all ahve a narrative about ourselves that shapes our self-perception.

If you want to change the story you have to understand where it comes from and where we received the messages that we tell ourselves.
Whose voices are we internalising?

Define your self perception by process and actions that you execute.

### Self-criticism

- What would you say to a good friend in the same situation?
  Now tell yourself the same thing.

## Shadow

We all have a dark side, hidden agression, envy, aggressive impulses - channel these into something positive/pro social like organising something for people.

## Shame

Don't ever be ashamed of anything you've done in your life. Face it, fix it, make it better.

## Stress

Stress relief strategies are:

- exercising
- yoga, meditation, breathing
- reading
- listening to music
- going for walk outside + go into nature
- PMR
- paint
- video games
- MBSR

### Eating

When I don't eat enough my body gets stressed

## Surrender

What is not servicing you let it go

you are on a path of experience for the purpose of your own growth and evolution and healing.

The voice in your head. The voice is something we listen to and think that it is us. But that voice is not you. You are the observer of the voice. You are not the thought because you are watching it.

Something that you are watching not something that you are.

When something comes into you that disturbes you you need to let go and pass it through you.
When a problem show up and your mind starts with chatter the first reaction is to lean away form it and relax into awareness.

Every moment of life is a spiritual experience.

You are causing the vast majority of you problems due to your mental reaction. Lean away from the mess that the mind is doing. Of overexagerating, overexemplifing.

We have gone to the mind. and said i'm not ok. how does everything need to be to be ok. We are trying to create that sitation. It doesnt work but we dont know it jet. We try to create situations that make us think we gonna be ok. And we things are changing and they don't match that model. We get scared.

Fear is a thing. It's another object in the universe that you are capable exeprencing. You either can push it away and avoid it or you can let go and let i go right through you.

Life is a natural unfolding of reality. You are suppose to harmonise and work with it. And not give up.

See if that voice that you are watching is actually helpful.

Remove the thorn you have inside of you. Disturbance is gonna show you the thorn you are having. What is happening is irritating the thorn.
Something happens outside. Deal with the disturbance this is how you remove the thorn. The fact something outside is stimulating the disturbance inside of you you uncovered somthing inside of you that needs to come out.

We need to use our problems as a way through the spiritual path. You should be exicited about your problem. Because they are an opportunity to see what is going on inside of you.
What do i do when i feel disturbance? I relax.

Look at your disturbances and see what your disturbances try to tell us about ourselves. The disturbances are you heart that something is wrong in side of you you want to get it out.
How do you get it out? You relax behind it.

## Struggles

The most situations that seem negative in the beginning actually bring something positive within - something to learn.

## Thoughts

Our thoughts shape our world.
Disidentify with your thoughts - your are not your thoughts. You are the observer.

Pay attention to any repetitive thought patterns.
