# Feel
Feelings are signals/messages.

If you have difficulty feeling your emotions start focusing your attention on the inner energy field in your body.

Not expressing your emotions can ahve severe physiological problems.


## Acceptance
Accept the present moment like you have chosen it to be like it is - unconditionally and without reservation

Anything you accept fully will get you there, will take you into peace.

Instead of surpressing unpleasant feelings, accept the feelings.

Accept what you have and how your life is.


## Approval
Low [self-esteem](be.md#self-loveesteem) and neglectful experiences with your first caregivers may make you constanty need and seek approval as an adult.

### Reflection
- When is it that you crave others approval most? At work?

### Tools

## Completeness
To fill the hole of feeling uncomplete we enter the pursuit of ego gratification and strive after possesions, money, success or recognition - so we can feel better about ourselves. But even with these things the hole is still there. 


## Dreams
In our dreams we process what we have experienced.

## Ego
Ego is always seeking for something to attach itself to in order to uphold and strengthen it's illusory sense of self. It will attach itself to your problems.

The ego's needs are endless.

## Emotions
Stop let your emotions drive our behaviour.

Emotions are your bodys reaction to your mind

## Forgive
Forgive other people, not necessarily because they deserve it but because you deserve it.

I decide to leave all the old relationships behind me. I decide to forgive.

## Mind
What we feel and think will determine what we experience - what we experience determines how we feel and think - never-ending-cycle

Our brains expectations are woven into everything we experience

## Pain
To disidentify from the pain bring precence into the pain and transmute it.

## Responisbilty
I am the cause of all my problems and therefore I alone am responsible and capable of solving them.

## Self-Perception
We all ahve a narrative about ourselves that shapes our self-perception.

If you want to change the story you have to understand where it comes from and where we received the messages that we tell ourselves.
Whose voices are we internalising?

Define your self perception by process and actions that you execute.

## Shadow
We all have a dark side, hidden agression, envy, aggressive impulses - channel these into something positive/pro social like organising something for people.


## Shame
Don't ever be ashamed of anything you've done in your life. Face it, fix it, make it better.

## Stress


## Struggles
The most situations that seem negative in the beginning actually bring something positive within - something to learn.
