# Fear/Anxiety
"Do something that scares you. Facing your fears makes you braver, smarter, and better able to withstand What life throws at you"

If you would die tmrw would you be scared to try what you are about to do? 

Fear is always of something that might happen, not of something that is happening now - Ask yourself is your fear realistic?

The body is receiving from the ego: Danger, I am under threat and the emotions generated are Fear

Worry of all forms like fear/ anxiety are caused by too much thinking about the future and not enough being in the present.

It is important to give attention to the fears instead of supressing them

aim is to change your interpretation of anxiety rather than suppressing the feeling itself


Try to account that your emotions and the expectations might have biased your perception

## Process 
Objective judgment, now, at this very moment.
Unselfish action, now, at this very moment.
Willing acceptance—now, at this very moment—of all external events.
That’s all you need.

## Avoidance

If something you've been putting off or keep "forgetting" to do, is it possible that you are trying to avoid facing your vulnerability? If so, just seeing the fear can help you make a rational choice—the motivations we understand are always easier to change than the influences we cannot see.

## Challenges

When a challenge comes into our life that triggers fear to stay present in the moment is important.

we never do anything of real significance in our comfort zone. > It’s when we’re stretched, face our fears, and reframe them that we can reach out and touch greatness.

Acknowledge that this Challenge is hard

## Reflection
- What nudges me towards fear or avoidance?
- Is fear you preventing from taking action?
- Are you worried?
- What exactly are you afraid of?
	- Is it fear of failure?
	- Fear of unknown?
	- Fear of missing out
- Do you have many "what if" thoughts?
- Are you identified with your mind?
- Is your mind projecting itself in to an imaginary future and creating fear?
