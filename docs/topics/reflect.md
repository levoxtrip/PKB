# Reflect

Carve out 15 minutes at the end of each week to look back at what you've accomplished.


## Reflection questions

### Challenge
- What did this experience taught me? What did you learn? What do you know now?

### Daily
- Are you doing your best work?
- Is this work in service of others?
- What can I learn from today?

### Expectations
- Do I have internalized negative expectations?
### Happiness
- What are you happy about? What are you unhappy about? Where does that feeling come from?
- What are you grateful for?

### Look inside
- What do I feel?
- What am I seeing?

###
- What action can I take to change my behavior or mindset?

### Results
- What causes that I don't get what I want?

### Values
- How would the person I want to become spend there time? 
- Do you want a life where you are successful in financial space on the cost of doing art and health?
- Would you rather be someone famous and influential for something that doesn't matter or be anonymous and unknown despite working on something that is insanely important?
