# Wakeup Challenge
"Respect is earned every day by waking up early, challenging yourself with new dreams...
and embracing the suck like you hav enothing and have never done a damn thing in your life." David Goggins.

Reignate you drive with a challenge that exceedes your limits. It needs to touch your fears.

## Self talk audits
Record your excuses/ complain your dread to do things that you have to. Then reread/relisten then and decide if that is the person you want to be/direct your life.

After that rerecord it again and then pretend you are motivating a friend to do the same.

The way we speak to ourselves in moments of doubt is curcial.
## Set a new standard
Doing above and beyond of what you are required to do!
*Are you just meeting the requirements or are you giving all you can give?*

Look inside - what more can you do?
