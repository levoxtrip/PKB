Delivery of a reward at irregular intervals - random determination has be determined to yield the greatest effort from the subject.


Create your own system of consequences and rewards that you take seriously:

Self-Imposed Penalties: Make a list of things you dislike doing or enjoy doing and attach these to deadlines. If you donâ€™t complete a task by your deadline, impose a penalty like donating to a cause you dislike or losing access to something you enjoy.

Self-Reward System: Set up specific rewards that you can only access once you hit a milestone or complete a project. This could be treating yourself to a favorite meal, a leisure activity, or some time off.
