# Intermitten Rewards

Create your own system of consequences and rewards that you take seriously:

Self-Imposed Penalties: Make a list of things you dislike doing or enjoy doing and attach these to deadlines. If you donâ€™t complete a task by your deadline, impose a penalty like donating to a cause you dislike or losing access to something you enjoy.
