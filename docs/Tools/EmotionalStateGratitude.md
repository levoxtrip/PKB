# Emotional State of Enormous Gratitude
The "Emotional State of Enormous Gratitude" exercise involves two parts:

1. **Current State**: Spend the first few minutes appreciating the people, things, and situations in your life that you are grateful for right now.
2. **Future State**: Visualize your ideal future and express gratitude for it as if it already exists.
where you want to be, and be grateful for the good things ahead and solving problems.
This helps your mind build certainty around your goals and supports you in achieving them.

If you're unsure what to be grateful for, ask yourself what you _could_ appreciate. Tony Robbins emphasizes that gratitude is key to fulfillment, as it enriches your life regardless of circumstances. By feeling and expressing gratitude deeply—both mentally and physically—you can elevate your emotional state and foster a positive outlook.

Prompts for reflection include:

- Who do you love, and who loves you?
- What are your current blessings (friends, opportunities, etc.)?
- What’s beautiful or magical in your life?
