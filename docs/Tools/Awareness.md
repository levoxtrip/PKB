# Awareness

Become aware of your breathing and feel the air flowing in and out. Feel your inner energy field.

It is the quality of your consciousness at this moment that is the main determinant of what kind of future you will experience

Feel the power of this moment and the fullness of Being. Feel your presence

Observe the mind. Smile at it.

the present moment is all you ever have

If you find it hard to enter the Now directly, start by observing the habitual tendency of your mind to want to escape from the Now.

Be present as the watcher of your mind of your thoughts and emotions as well as your reactions in various situations

Use your senses fully. Be where you are. Look around. Just look, don’t interpret. See the light, shapes, colors, textures. Be aware of the silent presence of each thing. Be aware of the space that allows everything to be. Listen to the sounds; don’t judge them. Listen to the silence underneath the sounds. Touch something anything and feel and acknowledge its Being. Observe the rhythm of your breathing; feel the air flowing in and out, feel the life energy inside your body. Allow everything to be, within and without.

The moment your attention turns to the Now, you feel a presence, a stillness, a peace

Make it conscious. Observe the many ways in which unease, discontent, and tension arise within you through unnecessary judgment, resistance to what is, and denial of the Now
