# Buffet Prio Test
STEP 1: Buffett started by asking Flint to write down his top 25 career goals.

For example, write down the top 25 things you want to accomplish this week.) STEP 2: Then, Buffett asked Flint to review his list and circle his top 5 goals.

STEP 3: At this point, Flint had two lists. The 5 items he had circled were List A and the 20 items he had not circled were List B.

Everything you didn’t circle just became your Avoid-At-All-Cost list.

No matter what, these things get no attention from you until you’ve succeeded with your top 5.”
