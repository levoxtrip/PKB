# Record reflection

Record a voicememo. with how you feel and and why you need urgently a break or why you can't finish this task.

Afterwards listen to that voice node and think if you are conficed by your arguments.

- Are your excuses valid or just a need to give up and comfort?


When you wake up tired and you don't want to do anything or have zero motivation record a voice memo and complain about the things you don't want to do.
Then play the memo again and ask yourself:
- Is this person in the message a person that you would like to be? Is this the voice that should lead your life?

After that record a new voice memo and act like you want to motivate a friend to do the same challenge.
