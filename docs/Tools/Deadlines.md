# Deadlines

If you have two days, it will take you two days. If you have only one day to complete a two-day job, somehow you find the time to do it.

The less time we have to do it, the more focused and organized we are.

The deadlines for festivals show you that deadlines help to motivate for todos and actually finish them.

Deadlines help you to cut away unnecessary elements to ensure timely delivery.
Deadlines forces to focus.

Make the deadline as specific as possible.

## Consequences

Use real consequences to have little pressure to it.

Attach a meaningful consequence or reward to your deadlines - If you miss a deadline, you could donate to a cause you don't support or restrict a privilege you enjoy.

## Projects

Set smaller checkpoints/dealines
