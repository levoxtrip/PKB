# Self Acceptance

Gratitude for Your Body:

List three things you appreciate about your body, considering both functionality and appearance.

Try to understand: Why did we act in a particular way in the past?

What part of yourself are you not yet able to accept?

What are three qualities or characteristics about yourself that you genuinely appreciate?

Best way to be accepted is to be yourself

The compulsion to do, and the tendency to derive your sense of self-worth and identity from external factors such as achievement, is an inevitable illusion as long as you are identified with the mind.
